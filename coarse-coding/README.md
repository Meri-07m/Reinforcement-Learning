# ðŸ§  Coarse Coding for Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to the **`coarse-coding`** directory of the **[Reinforcement-Learning](https://github.com/Meri-07m/Reinforcement-Learning)** repository by **[Meri-07m](https://github.com/Meri-07m)**. This module explores the concept of **coarse coding**â€”a technique used in reinforcement learning to generalize across similar states by representing them with overlapping features. This approach is particularly useful in environments with large or continuous state spaces.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Coarse coding is a form of **function approximation** that utilizes a set of overlapping binary features to represent states. Each feature encodes a specific property of the state, and multiple features can be active simultaneously, allowing for a nuanced representation of states. This method helps in generalizing the learning process across similar states, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms.

In this module, we implement coarse coding using **tile coding** and **radial basis functions (RBFs)**, and integrate them with reinforcement learning algorithms such as **Q-learning** and **SARSA**.

## ðŸ§  Background

In reinforcement learning, function approximation is essential for dealing with large or continuous state spaces. Traditional methods like **tabular Q-learning** become impractical as the state space grows. Coarse coding addresses this issue by:

- **Generalizing across similar states**: Representing similar states with overlapping features allows the agent to generalize its learning.
- **Reducing dimensionality**: By using overlapping features, the representation becomes more compact, reducing the complexity of the learning process.
- **Improving learning efficiency**: Generalization leads to faster convergence and better performance in complex environments.

### ðŸ”¹ Tile Coding

Tile coding is a specific form of coarse coding where the state space is divided into multiple overlapping grids, or "tiles". Each tile represents a binary feature, and multiple tiles can be active simultaneously for a given state. This method provides a compact and efficient representation of continuous states.

### ðŸ”¹ Radial Basis Functions (RBFs)

RBFs are another form of coarse coding where each feature is represented by a Gaussian function centered at a specific point in the state space. The activation of each feature depends on the distance between the state and the center of the Gaussian function. RBFs provide a smooth and continuous representation of states.

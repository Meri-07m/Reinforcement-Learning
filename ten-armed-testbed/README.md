# ðŸŽ° Ten-Armed Testbed with Reinforcement Learning

This project implements the **Ten-Armed Testbed**, a classic problem in reinforcement learning used to evaluate the performance of various action-selection strategies, particularly focusing on the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Ten-Armed Testbed consists of 10 slot machines (arms), each with a different, fixed probability distribution for generating rewards. The objective is to determine which arm to pull to maximize the cumulative reward over time. This problem is ideal for testing algorithms like Îµ-greedy, UCB, and others in a controlled, stochastic environment.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Implemented

The project includes implementations of the following reinforcement learning algorithms:

- **Îµ-Greedy**: Selects the action with the highest estimated value most of the time, but with probability Îµ, selects a random action to encourage exploration.
- **Optimistic Initialization**: Initializes action-value estimates to high values to encourage exploration.

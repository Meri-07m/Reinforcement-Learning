# üß© Updates Comparison ‚Äî Reinforcement Learning Project

Welcome to the **Updates Comparison** module of the **Reinforcement Learning** project by [**Meri-07m**](https://github.com/Meri-07m).  
This subproject is dedicated to **comparing different reinforcement learning update algorithms** ‚Äî such as Q-Learning, SARSA, and Expected SARSA ‚Äî across various environments to better understand their **learning efficiency, stability, and convergence behavior**.

## üåç Project Overview

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns how to act in an environment by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards.  
In RL, different **update rules** determine *how* the agent adjusts its value estimates (or policies) after each step.

This module provides an experimental framework to:

- Compare **on-policy** and **off-policy** update methods  
- Analyze **learning curves** and **variance**
- Evaluate **convergence rates**
- Study **hyperparameter sensitivities**
- Produce visualizations for clear algorithmic comparison

The goal is to **develop intuition** about how different algorithms behave and which are most suitable for various environments.
